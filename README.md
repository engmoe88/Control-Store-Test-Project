# Control-Store-Test-Project
Automating Test cases for Control Store application using C# and N-unit in Visual Studio.
Control Store application is a sample application was provided to me by my instructor Prof. Dan Geiger at Bellevue College to write and automate test cases for.
I wrote the code for three sections of the application:
1- The CheckBox section.
2- The Radio Button Section.
3- The Combo Box Section.
I wrote the code to test the functionality of each control and ensure the proper functionality.
